# To teach is to learn twice.

# What if the opposite of what you believe is true?

- I will lose respect if I fail
- I must specialize, stay in my lane
- I can't keep learning my whole career
- I can't know everything (at sufficient resolution)
- A good teacher can't fail in front of students
- My demos must work without error to be effective


# Expert does not know it all, but how to discover and use it all
- think about image compression into the RAM of your brain
- Before cloud we could fit the knowledge in, had to use references less
- Cloud means more data to store in same RAM, so STORE AT A LOWER RESOLUTION
  - Store how to find the data when you need it
    - Search terms to find reference pages
    - 
  
# Learning one aspect of cloud teaches a pattern useful all cloud (Cloud widgets)

# We learn and teach more when it breaks than when it works

# Seek competence, not mastery. Learn all at depth 1 or 2, with a few deep topics of strength.

# Learning 'approaches' in a spectrum between hello world tutorials and open hacks.

# Pace Layering - Cloud is built in layers, lower layer knowledge persists longer when upper layers more fragile

 - What can you learn that changes slowly in the cloud?

# Evergreen tools and technologies
 - Command line & shell (PowerShell & Bash)
 - Containers
 - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

# Command line is the cloud superpower
- Tools designed to be understood and applied
- Learn once, apply anywhere
- Self documenting, repeatable, shareable, learnable
- Close to the 'metal' (ARM REST API) while being usable, right layer of abstraction

# Do you know about Microsoft's test algorithm that gives you bonus points for each Azure test you have taken in the past? The more tests you take, the more bonus points you get on the next test!
- While this may not be ACTUALLY true, it is FUNCTIONALLY true
- The more tests you take, the EASIER they are to pass, as your knowledge aboutu the shared characteristics of the cloud grows.
- Examples
  - RBAC
  - SKUs
  - Regions
  - Syntax
    - PowerShell
    - CLI
    - ARM
    - C#

# Training that is polished and professional can actually be less effective than raw live content with errors & typos.

- Can add 'distance' to be perceived as less attainable than a training that includes hiccups.
- Effort devoted to 'polish' can be better spent learning and sharing closer to real time.
